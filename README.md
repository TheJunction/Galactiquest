## Basic Gameplay
* Players have access to minimal resources
* Players start off in a basic spaceship (possibly a retextured elytra) and have to mine resources from meteors until they have enough to build a space station
* In space, they are required to wear a “spacesuit” (retextured armor)
* Big and bulky so they have some slowness and get tired easily
* In a completely sealed-off space station, they take off their space suits
* In the space station they can build like farms, etc to get resources from that, instead of using up fuel to go outside to mine resources
* After building a space station, players can add upgrades to their spaceship
* Larger space station = more players that can join
* Important to keep space station sealed: if the outer wall(s) is/are broken, the oxygen will escape, players without space suits on will die, plants will die
* To expand, need to build a wall around the wall that they plan to break
* Players can upgrade spaceships for long distance flight and warp to the vicinity of other space stations (each space station will be in a separate world)
* No spawn: players start with a tutorial, then get thrown into a spaceship to start
* If players die, either go to space station if they have one or restart with a spaceship
* Gravity inside space station, nowhere else
* Space stations can team up, allies can warp to each other’s space stations

## Future ideas:
* Procedurally generated planets: they initially are huge spheres with blocks on armorstand heads, but when players enter the atmosphere they get teleported to another world with the planet as that world
* Alien invasions?
